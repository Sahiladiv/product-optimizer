I have a sensitive nose, so it's not overpowering at all, and still allows the fragrance to permeate the room really nicely. The color is a really pretty purple, so even in the evening light, I know which candle I'm lighting. It's lasted a long time, and I've still got wax to burn haha. Great size for the price, and works really well! Read more",

The candle looks very luxurious, now the smell I do not like. In my opinion smells nothing like fresh linen. To me this product smells like a cologne instead and not a good smelling one similar to the ones that give you a headache after a while is the best way to explain it. Maybe I chose the wrong scent but this scent is a no for me. I would recommend these shoes candle but in a different scent. Read more",

      "verified_purchase": false,
      "review_text": "There several large spots and imperfections in the glass jar that really stand out. It looks like the inside of the glass had adhesive or was dirty before they poured the candle. It is inside the jar, so it cannot be cleaned off. It is all around all sides of the candle making it not very attractive. Because of this I would not give it as a gift and don't love having it as a decoration in my home.It does come nicely packaged, secure with Styrofoam inside a box. The candle has 2 wicks and the smell is a nice subtle scent of spice. The candle is a nice size and has a nice wood lid. If it weren't for the ugly spots all around the glass then this would be a nice candle. Read more",

      "verified_purchase": false,
      "review_text": "Wow. I was having one of those awful, stressful days, and the minute I lit this candle it was like the tension just melted away. Honestly, I could smell the lavender oak before I even took it out of the box, and once lit, it filled the entire room with the most relaxing, spa-like scent. Within minutes I felt myself sink into a puddle of calm.This is hands-down the most highly scented candle I\u2019ve ever burned. I only had it lit for about an hour before I had to get back to real life, but the fragrance lingered for hours. At one point I was in the pantry\u2014which is behind a bathroom that\u2019s behind my office, with all the doors shut, and I could still smell it! That\u2019s how strong and long-lasting the scent throw is.On top of that, it\u2019s a clean-burning soy candle in a chic jar with a wooden lid, so it doubles as d\u00e9cor and can be reused later. If you\u2019re looking for a candle that truly delivers on relaxation and fragrance power, this one is amazing. Read more",
